    "# Heatmap-gen\n",
    "This notebook collects all the steps to generate a heatmap from a Strava archive or just a collection of gpx files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generating a heatmap from a Strava archive consists of the following steps:\n",
    "- Convert non-gpx files to gpx, collect metadata of gpx files\n",
    "- Merge all the gpx files of certain activity types together into one large gpx\n",
    "- (Optional) Generate the background map for the heatmap, alternatively: use one of the pregenerated ones\n",
    "- Generate the heatlayer(s) from the merged gpx files and put them on the background map\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to use\n",
    "Each step has its own section. The section starts with some explanation about what the section does and how to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the textblock, there is usually a codeblock with parameter definitions (in all caps).\n",
    "You can change the behaviour of the code by changing the values of these parameters.\n",
    "This should be the only part of the code where you need to make changes!\n",
    "The following blocks of code execute all necessary operations for that step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each step can be run separately. For example if you have already generated maps or use pregenerated ones, you can skip the step \"generate maps\". If you just want to regenerate a heatmap with different colors, running only the last step is enough."
